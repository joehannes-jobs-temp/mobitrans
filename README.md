## Run the app

1) After the `git clone` please do an `npm install`
2) You got various modes of starting the app:
    * `./bin/genius.sh`
    * `node index.js`
    * `npm start`

## Examine the code

Please have a look at the `src`-folder, not the lib, which is the transpiled ES5 version.

## Important - 4 Phun

Please do have a look into the assets folder ... even the node guys think I'm a node hacker!!
